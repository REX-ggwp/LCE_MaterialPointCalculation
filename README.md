# LCE_MaterialPointCalculation
A material point calculation for the viscous constitutive law of liquid crystal elastomer implemented in MATLAB
1. LCE.m is the class file that defines how to calculate the stress when a strain and history variable is given.
2. Load.m is the file to do uniaxial loading. Only Load.m needs to be modified if you want to change loading.
3. Execute Load.m to run the material point calculation. Material parameters are also set in Load.m
